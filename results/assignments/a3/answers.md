1-Which are the units for area and runoff in our records?

Units in our records:
Area is in km² (square kilometers)
Runoff is in m³/s (cubic meters per second)

2-Which is the average catchment area and runoff of Rhine, according to our data? Write a script that performs the calculation.

Average catchment area and runoff of Rhine:
Average catchment area: 74,490.29 km²
Average runoff: 1,372.79 m³/s
The runoff values range from 11 m³/s (minimum) to 13,000 m³/s (maximum)
The catchment areas range from 3,229 km² to 160,800 km²

3-Which is the average runoff in each station? Present them in a graph.

Average runoff by station:
The script has successfully created a bar plot showing the average runoff for each station with error bars (saved as 'average_runoff_by_station.png' in the results/assignments/a3 directory).

4-Is there any relationship between station altitude and catchment area? Why?


Relationship between station altitude and catchment area:
There is a strong negative correlation between altitude and area (correlation coefficient = -0.861). This strong negative relationship makes sense because:
Stations at higher altitudes are typically in the headwaters of the river where catchment areas are smaller
As the river flows downstream to lower altitudes, it accumulates more tributary areas, resulting in larger catchment areas
This is a natural characteristic of river systems where upstream (high altitude) stations have smaller catchment areas, and downstream (low altitude) stations have larger catchment areas as they collect water from all upstream tributaries
The correlation of -0.861 indicates that this relationship is quite strong in the Rhine River system, which is typical for major river systems where the main stem flows from mountainous regions to lowland areas.
